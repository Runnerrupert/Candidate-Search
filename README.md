## Description

This website was created to allow for better UI/UX for viewing different potential candidates information. 

---

## How to Install

This project does not require installation, just go to the website: https://candidate-search-0c3h.onrender.com 

---

## Usage

This website is used to see information about different Github users. On the "Home" page, you can add the data given for a Candidate using the + button, or move on to another Candidate using the - button. Given that this data is pulled using the github API, there are a lot of users that do not have much information. When a user is added using the green + button, they are stored within the "Potential Candidates" page.

Within the Potential Candidates page, a table is provided with all the information for each candidate you have chosen to add. You can remove a candidate by pressing on the - button next to that specific candidates information.
